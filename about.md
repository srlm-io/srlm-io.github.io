## My History

Jobs, projects, tech stuff.


### Formlabs

I currently work at Formlabs, where I develop software that makes our printers great.

### Red9

Red9 helps users draw insights from large amounts of dynamic motion sensor data. Our technology helps athletes perform better with the equipment that they already have, and helps designers build the latest in high performance products.

At Red9 I developed the hardware recorder PCB and firmware, an Android app, a data analytics web platform, and a marketing website.
