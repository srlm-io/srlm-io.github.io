# My Work History

Jobs, projects, tech stuff.

I currently contract with Formlabs, after working there full time for four years.

At Formlabs, I maintained all the factory software that allowed production of our 3D printing related products

During the winter, I teach snowboarding part time. I'm a Level 1 certified instructor with the American Association of Snowboard Instructors.

> Red9 helps users draw insights from large amounts of dynamic motion sensor data. Our technology helps athletes perform better with the equipment that they already have, and helps designers build the latest in high performance products.

At Red9 I developed the hardware recorder PCB and firmware, an Android app, a data analytics web platform, and a marketing website. Check out my [blog post](https://srlm.io/2018/02/17/red9-data-science-platform/) for details on what I did. Check out [libpropeller](https://github.com/libpropeller/libpropeller) for an open source, lean and efficient C++ library optimized for the Parallax Propeller that I developed while working for Red9.

## B.S. Computer Science

I graduated in 2012 with a degree in computer science from the University of California, Riverside. Besides classwork at UCR, I spent a year as Vice Chair of the IEEE student branch, and three years as a Resident Advisor for an engineering residence hall.
